For normal package transfer in APIs, TCP/IP is used i.e., for transporting data.
For live video streaming and voice calls RTP is used.
For web access http/https is used.

Types of APIs other than REST are:

1. SOAP
2. JSON RPC and XML RPC

If a website is using REST API, its data will always be in JSON format.
